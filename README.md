Thought proccess:

1. I implemented a 2xX grid, where X is based on the number of total cards.
2. I opted to use MUI for the entire project. The cards, dropdown menu, grid are all imported from MUI. I felt that MUI provided an elegant solution.
3. Some things are not perfect and I would improve given more time: I would modularize the code further, currently only 1 componenet stands entirely on its own (CustomCard) by making the filter/dropdown menu its own componenet, and improve the use of layout, integrate proper css, etc.
